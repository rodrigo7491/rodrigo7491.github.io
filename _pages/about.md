I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Groningen, Netherlands, investigating the use of logic as a means to ensure robustness of the systems underlying our digital infrastructure. My research focuses on automated reasoning, through the lenses of verification, synthesis, and certification. In particular, I am interested in bridging the gap between theory and practice via techniques that enable push-button automation, such as model checking. My work primarily targets systems which have distribution as a key feature, including blockchains and quantum networks.

On a more technical note, I have experience in topics such as symbolic model checking, SMT and CHC solving, TLA+ specifications, process algebras, smart contracts, and entanglement-based networks.

For full details, please see my CV.

I have an **open PhD position** on the topic of formal verification of distributed systems, the full details can be found [here].
