I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at **USI Lugano**, Switzerland, working on approaches for automated reasoning in the contexts of verification, synthesis, and certification.

I will be joining the **University of Groningen** as an assistant professor in September 2025. I have an **open PhD position** on the topic of formal verification of distributed systems, the full details can be found [here].
